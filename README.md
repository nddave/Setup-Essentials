# Setup Essentials

![alt](setupessentials.jpg)

This unique repository consists of different essential setup methods that I have figured out after debugging, trial &amp; error and hours of work. I am documenting these methods to make sure they come handy in future if needed.

Please follow the files in the [Essentials](https://github.com/nddave/Setup-Essentials/tree/master/Essentials) folder which lists necessary setup methods. More setup methods will be added periodically.
